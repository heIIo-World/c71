        <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">It's a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Must haired tour guide so it will be batter to under stand all the things. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago</p>

            <p> This was an amazing movie with lots of twists, turns, suspense, shock, and sad scenes. It has a great plot and combines all the side-stories going on into one. Be warned: there is blood, gore and darker themes. The movie is also about 3 hours long, making it perfect to watch on a weekend. The only real requirement for watching this is to have been following MCU movies for a while, or at least having watched movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp, Civil War, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and of course, Avengers: Infinity War.</p>

            <p> The Madrigal family live in the mountains of Columbia, in a magical house, in a magical town, in a magical place called an encanto. The entire encanto is blessed by a magical candle, referred to by the town as a miracle, as it had saved them 50 years before the movie takes place. The family consists of Alma Madrigal, her triplets - Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno, who left the Encanto 10 years ago. Pepa is married to Felix and has three children, while Julieta is married to Agustin and has 3 children, including the protagonist, Mirabel. The candle has blessed each Madrigal with a magical gift, ranging from super strength to controlling the weather. Mirabel is the only one who didn't get a gift. Their house starts to crack, and Mirabel must save the encanto, while being estranged from her family. </p>
